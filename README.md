In this guided project, the focus is on analyzing data from the hospitality domain, specifically for AtliQ Grands, a fictional hotel chain. The project aims to help the revenue team make data-driven decisions to regain market share and revenue.

The project begins with data extraction from various sources, including Excel files and databases. Python and Pandas are used for initial data cleaning and transformation, preparing the data for analysis in Power BI.

After data preparation, the clean data is imported into Power BI. Further data transformation is performed using Power Query, including creating relationships between tables and developing DAX measures for in-depth analysis.

The dashboard building process is then demonstrated. The instructor guides through designing and constructing a visually appealing and informative dashboard. The dashboard includes multiple pages focusing on different aspects of the hotel chain's performance, such as revenue, occupancy rates, and booking channels.

Finally, the project involves analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), ADR (Average Daily Rate), and DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights). These metrics are used to gain insights into the hotel chain's performance and identify areas for improvement.

Key Takeaways:
+ The project showcases an end-to-end data analytics workflow in the hospitality industry, from data extraction to visualization and insight generation.
+ It highlights the use of Python for initial data preparation and Power BI for advanced analysis and dashboard creation.
+ The project emphasizes the importance of understanding domain-specific metrics and KPIs in the hospitality sector for effective decision-making.
+ It demonstrates how to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards that provide actionable insights for business stakeholders.
